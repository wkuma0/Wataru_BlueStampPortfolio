# Self Driving Car
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

# Final Milestone

**Don't forget to replace the text below with the embedding for your milestone video. Go to Youtube, click Share -> Embed, and copy and paste the code to replace what's below.**

For my final milestone, I was able to complete my project and add an LCD display as well as a buzzer that creates a sound when an obstacle avoidance module detects an object. I basically combined the code from the previous milestone such as the codes from the ultrasonic sensor, obstacle avoidance module, and remote control into a code that also incorporates the buzzer and LCD display. For the LCD display I needed to add an array and for the buzzer, I added it to the if states that were created for recognizing the distance of the objects. So if the object is far from the module, no buzzer; if the object is close, buzzer. Towards the beginning of the program, I was pretty new to coding in C++ but I gradually understood what was going on in my codes which was then used to make modifications and go out of the box. One of the biggest challenges was coding in general so I was very happy when my final product worked with the code that I created. 
For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE



# Second Milestone

For my second milestone, I added the ultrasonic sensor and obstacle avoidance module into 1 so the car can recognize its surroundings better. I also added a remote control so I'm able to control the car as it moves around my house. While I did face some challenges, I was able to successfully combine codes from the ultrasonic sensor, obstacle avoidance module, and remote control into 1 big code so the car can maximize it's efficiency. I plan to do something with LED lights or an LCD display that could be attached to my car for decoration.
# First Milestone


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RwIAatDmi6w?si=q0mf3e7-UfD1SuES" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My first milestone was constructing the self-driving car and running test codes to see how the car would operate. One of the problems I faced was the car stopping after I unplugged it from my PC. After close examination, I figured out that it was because of the battery. After multiple trials, it can go forward, backward, left, and right with a sample code. 

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
